Hong Kong Districts (Bilingual) - 香港市區(中英文)
===================

A bilingaul English & Chinese seed database of all the major districts &amp; areas of Hong Kong.

This Ruby seed file, is a reference to all the districts, areas and regions in Hong Kong. Such as that used by OpenRice, and other applications that use a colloquial reference to Hong Kong's areas. 

It is the key-value pairs are mapped approximately like this: 

```ruby
[eng_name: "Tung Chung", chi_name: "東涌", eng_region: "Lantau Island", chi_region: "大嶼山"]
```

I have sections for:

* Hong Kong Island 香港島
* Kowloon 九龍
* New Territories 新界
* Lantau Island 大嶼山
* Outlying Islands 離島區

In the end of the day, however you have decided to organise your database, the raw data entry is here so you don't have to spend hours finding it and typing it in. 

Please use, enjoy and buy me a cup of coffee someday if you appreciate :)
